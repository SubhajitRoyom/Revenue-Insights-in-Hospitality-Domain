## 🔎 Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments.

To regain their competitive position, management decided to incorporate **Business & Data Intelligence** into their strategy. Since they did not have an in-house analytics team, a third-party service provider was hired to extract actionable insights from historical data.

As a Data Analyst, my responsibility was to:

- Create metrics according to the provided metric list  
- Build an interactive dashboard based on stakeholder mock-up  
- Generate additional business insights beyond the given requirements
